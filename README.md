## About

Philoi is Greek for "friend" :)

Usually, when groups, students, or even friends get to know each other they begin with some facts about themselves. Some teachers would play a game of (two truths/one lie) with their students, so they can start building a strong bond with the students.

This app aims to tackle this aspect of social life using a game led by a host (who creates questions) and played by a group of people.

Why?
* New way introduction system
* Get conversations going in a group

## Roadmap
- [x] Create a video demoing the app and add it to the site.
- [ ] When a game is played, make it so that it can be done in two ways:
  - A quick game, where the players answer themselves.
  - A discussion game, where the host puts in the answers of each player (which is the current method).
- [ ] When creating a quiz, implement a way where players can make questions instead of the host.
- [ ] Create a voting system to determine whether a question is good or bad.
  - If the majority of players votes bad for that question, the player who made that question loses a point.
