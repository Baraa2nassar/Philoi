Philoi is Greek for "friend" :)

This project is developed by Baraa Nassar and Mushtaq Miah.

Usually, when groups, students, or even friends get to know each other they begin with some facts about themselves. Some teachers would play a game of (two truths/one lie) with their students, so they can start building a strong bond with the students. This app aims to tackle this aspect of social life using a game hosted by an instructor (creator) and played by group

Why?
* New way introduction system
* Get conversations going in a group


<!-- ## Getting Started -->


## Roadmap

- [x] Create a README
- [x] Host the site at philoi.tech
- [ ] Fix the rules page
- [ ] Enable users to put password of their game sessions
- [ ] Use git command linked to cloud
- [ ] Enable a way where people can put in questions remotely (sockets)
- [ ] Create a short video demoing and link it here

*Ideas for the online version*:
  - [ ] When playing a round = Quick game(ppl answer) **vs** Discussion game(host puts the answers)
  - [ ] When Creating a round =  Ppl's choice (particpants put in facts) **vs** Host's choice (Host puts the participants and the questions)
  - [ ] Voting system to whether the question is good or bad (if the majority puts in bad the person loses a point).
