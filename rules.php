            <p>Philoi is a quiz game designed to test how well friends know each other.</p>
            <p>To play, one person will serve as the organizer. They will be the one to create a set of questions for a group of 3-5 friends each.</p>
            <p>The organizer will also act as a game host. After creating a new quiz and starting the game, it will be organizer's job to input each answer the players give.</p>
            <p>As for how the players can see the game, the organizer can either share their screen to everyone or the players can be together in a physical location.</p>
