Hey! Thanks for asking, no you are not annoying anyone, we are happy to help. The main thing I wanna point out here is PHP is more web based so you can use it if your application is web based as well. As for better ways, I would Google up things like - "database system for quiz based games" or "types of database systems" and make some comparisons. 

Hope that helps! Feel free to ask follow up questions.

the admin will select on the behalf of others.
